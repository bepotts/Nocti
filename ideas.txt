Some feature ideas

* Change Desktop background ( this will involve pointing to files)
* Make only one record possible
* Pull that record from storage on boot
* Make sure it persists when the app exits
* Make the stored theme be the default toggle on boot up
* Add support for 24 hour times
* Make the attach to the menu bar
